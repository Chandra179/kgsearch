# Architecture of Search Systems with Knowledge Graphs

Integrating a knowledge graph into a search system involves multiple components that work together to ingest, store, and query data effectively. Here's an overview of the architecture:

## Data Sources

The foundation of a knowledge graph is data from various sources:

- Structured Data: Databases, APIs, metadata.
- Unstructured Data: Documents, webpages, audio, and video.
- Crowdsourced Data: User inputs, reviews, or annotations (e.g., Wikipedia).
- External Knowledge Bases: Wikidata, DBpedia, Freebase, etc.

## Data Ingestion and Processing

Converts raw data into a graph-friendly structure.

- ETL Pipeline: Extract, Transform, Load.
  - Extract: Pull data from sources.
  - Transform: Clean, normalize, and structure data.
  - Load: Insert into a graph database.
- Entity Extraction: Identifies entities (e.g., names, locations) using NLP.
- Relationship Extraction: Maps relationships between entities (e.g., "Elon Musk → founded → Tesla").
- Data Deduplication: Eliminates redundant entities or facts.

## Knowledge Graph Storage

- Graph Databases: Designed to store nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).
  Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB, or JanusGraph.
- RDF Stores: For semantic data representation using triples (subject → predicate → object).
  Example: SPARQL queries for RDF-based knowledge graphs.

## Indexing

A search index is built on top of the knowledge graph to allow fast query responses.

- Search Engine Integration: Elasticsearch or Apache Solr can be combined with the graph database for efficient querying.
- Graph Embeddings: Transforms the graph into a vector space for semantic search and ML integration.

## Query Engine

The core component that interprets search queries and retrieves relevant data.

- SPARQL Queries: For RDF-based graphs.
- Graph Query Languages: Cypher (Neo4j), Gremlin, or GraphQL.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables users to ask queries in plain language (e.g., "Who founded Tesla?").

## Search Interface

User-facing systems that utilize the knowledge graph to display results.

- Knowledge Panels: Provide entity-specific information (e.g., Google's right-side panels).
- Rich Snippets: Display specific answers with supporting context.
- Auto-Suggestions: Powered by predictive algorithms.
